# Actimoji test site

## What is this?

This project is a dumbed-down version of our game, Actimoji. In actimoji, 1 player gets a random
word and they should type it out with emojis. The others have to guess the word. There are also
forbidden emojis for each word that you can't use to describe it.

## But that's not what this does at all!

Correct! This is only a test site. For now, we just have something that will generate a random
word for us and we do everything else manually, on discord.

## Why?

We did this to see how the game would work overall, and get some insight into how we should plan
the game.

## Where can I access it?
